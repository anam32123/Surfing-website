<p>Surfing is a sport that is currently gaining popularity. Originally from the islands of Polynesia, it was brought to the rest of the world from Hawai’i. Many of the world’s best surfers still hail from Hawai’i. Surfing is unique in that it is more than a sport, it is a lifestyle and pastime. Some of the best surfers in the world do not even surf in competitions.</p>
